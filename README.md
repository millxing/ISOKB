2-channel Isomorphic MIDI keyboard for norns and grid

Here is a simple isomorphic “in-key” MIDI keyboard for Norns and Grid. There are two MIDI channels, one for each hand. Only notes in the selected scale are shown, with the tonic highlighted. The notes are arranged with five semitones between each row (each note is a fourth from the note below it).

Of course, you’ll need a midi interface to send the MIDI to an external synth or DAW.
                                               
Select a tonic note and one of nine 7-note scales (default C Major).

Two independent keyboards, each sends MIDI to a different MIDI channel. Left hand notes go to MIDI 1. Right hand notes go to MIDI 2.

There will be multiple buttons for each note and all buttons corresponding to a pressed note will light up.
